This is a repository for code samples for the book by Yakov Fain and Anton Moiseev <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Angular-Development-TypeScript-Yakov-Fain/dp/1617293121">Angular 2 Development with TypeScript</a>. 

All code samples were upgraded to Angular 2.0 or later releases. 

**Reporting errors:**  If you'll run into a bug in the code, please open an issue here. If you want to report errors or typos in the book text, please report it at the <a href="https://forums.manning.com/forums/angular-2-development-with-typescript">book's forum</a> in the Errata section.

To start a new SystemJS-based project use the seed project from chapter 2. To create a new Webpack-based project use the seed angular2-webpack-seed from chapter 10. 

If you prefer to work with Angular-CLI based projects, use code samples located in the directory extras. Some of those code samples where created after the book was released.

The video with a code review of a sample online auction application that we gradually develop in the book is located at https://youtu.be/I809tajbVk4.
